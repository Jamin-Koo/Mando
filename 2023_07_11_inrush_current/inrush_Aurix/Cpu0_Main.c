 /*\title GTM TOM interrupt
 * \abstract The GTM TOM is configured to trigger an interrupt every 500 ms. The interrupt toggles an LED.
 * \description The Generic Timer Module triggers an interrupt every 500 ms. The state of the port pin,
 *              where the LED is connected, is toggled inside the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
